    Delete the GraphElement (and all its children) from the query graph and
    head.
  description: >-
    This route is used when the user wants to delete a node from the query
    graph. All the children of this node will be deleted as well as we do not
    want to create query with completly separated branches. All the variables
    that are going to be deleted should also be deleted from the head of the
    query. **WARNING**, if the node has multiple occurrences (due to join
    operations) every node should be deleted.
