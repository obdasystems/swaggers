    This route is used by the VKG to ask properties of an instance creating a
    query for each group of properties sharing a view. Shared views by entities
    are computed based on the mappings of the specified endpoint. -- The
    neighbours can be classes (brother classes or child classes), object
    properties (the class or one of his father partecipate or are typed to
    domain/range) or data properties (the class or one of its fathers
    partecipates or is typed to its domain).
