  summary: Join two GraphNodeElement in one.
  description: >-
    Starting from a query graph which has two nodes representing the same
    class(es), it returns the query graph in which the two nodes have been
    joined into a single one. The children of the selected nodes will be grouped
    in `graphElementId1` and each time we add a children through the previous
    routes they will be added to this node.
